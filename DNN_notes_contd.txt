Programming noise
After the target conductances have been defined, they are programmed on the PCM devices of the hardware using a closed-loop 
iterative write-read-verify scheme [4]. The conductance values programmed in this way on the hardware will have a certain error 
compared with the target values. This error is characterized by the programming noise. The programming noise is modeled based on 
the standard deviation of the iteratively programmed conductance values measured from hardware.

The equations used in the statistical model to implement the programming noise are (where we use small letters for the elements of the matrices W and, Gt etc.
 and omit the indeces for brevity):

gprog = gt + N(0,omega prog)
omega prog = max(-1.1731gt^2 + 1.9650gt + 0.2635, 0)

Drift
After they have been programmed, the conductance values of PCM devices drift over time. This drift is an intrinsic property of the 
phase-change material of a PCM device and is due to structural relaxation of the amorphous phase [5]. Knowing the conductance at time tc
from the last programming pulse, gprog , the conductance evolution can be modeled as:

 gdrift(t) = gprog(t/tc)^-v

where v is the drift exponent which exhibits variability across a PCM array and a dependence on the target conductance state gt.
