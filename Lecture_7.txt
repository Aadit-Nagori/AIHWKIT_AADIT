Lidar for Autonomous Driving 

Signal/Noise = ((laser*reflectivity)/Range^2) * aperture * photon2electron_eff)/(Ambient Noise + Detector Noise)


Safety
Providing hazard indications to avoid safety events
to the driver or its surrounding

Can create sudden brakes
Can create sudden maneuvers
Can create sudden accelerations

Examples: Misbehavior of other cars or pedestrians,
extraordinary obstacles (tire debris, potholes etc.)

Comfort
Providing road insights to provide high quality
and relaxed user experience driving

No sudden brakes
No sudden maneuvers
No sudden accelerations

Examples: Detection and Classification of
Pedestrians, Vehicles and Trucks.

Perception Requirements: Classification is important in order to have good trajectory prediction

Vertical resolution improvement is more critical than frame rate and range

 

Point Collision-Relevant Classification

for p1 in points:
	for p2 in points:
		if p2 == pl:
			continue

		if L2(p1,p2) < max_distance and abs(p1(2]-p2{2])) > collision_height:
			collision_relevant_points.append(p1) a=
