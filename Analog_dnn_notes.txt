The analog AI hardware kit provides a state-of-the-art statistical model of a phase-change memory (PCM) array that can be used when performing 
inference to simulate the various sources of noise that are present in a real hardware [1]. This model is calibrated based on extensive measurements 
performed on an array containing 1 million PCM devices fabricated at IBM [2].

PCM is a key enabling technology for non-volatile electrical data storage at the nanometer scale, which can be used for analog AI [3].
A PCM device consists of a small active volume of phase-change material sandwiched between two electrodes. In PCM, data is stored by using 
the electrical resistance contrast between a high-conductive crystalline phase and a low-conductive amorphous phase of the phase-change material. 
The phase-change material can be switched from low to high conductive state, and vice-versa, through applying electrical current pulses. 
The stored data can be retrieved by measuring the electrical resistance of the PCM device. An appealing attribute of PCM is that the 
stored data is retained for a very long time (typically 10 years at room temperature), but is written in only a few nanoseconds.

The model simulates three different sources of noise from the PCM array: programming noise, read noise and temporal drift. The model is 
only used during inference and therefore it is assumed that network weights have been trained beforehand in software. The diagram below 
explains how these three sources of noise are incorporated during inference when using the statistical model:
